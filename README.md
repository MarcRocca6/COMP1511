## Introduction to Programming

## Course Summary

Welcome to COMP1511! This course is an introduction to solving problems, and the craft of designing and implementing elegant software solutions. Along the way, we'll introduce fundamental concepts of programming and of software development, the C programming language, and programming in teams. We look forward to joining you on your first computing adventures!

## Assumed Knowledge

COMP1511 has no prerequisites, and assumes no background knowledge or prior programming experience.

## Student Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will be able to:

design complete software solutions for simple problems
work in a team to develop software
test and debug programs
create and use simple data structures
have a solid understanding of values, storage and addressing
understand and appropriately use abstraction
write programs using good programming style
distinguish between well-written programs and poorly written programs
design software solutions for larger problems using abstraction and interfaces
reflect on their programming and develop the ability to continually improve their skills

## Teaching Rationale

As with playing a musical instrument, computer programming cannot be learnt by simply watching and listening. Hands-on experience emphasised through lab work and assignments is essential in mastering the skills taught in this course.

Computing is best learned by practice, and thus labs and programming assignments are a critical component of the course. These allow students to practice design and implementation skills, and to develop teamwork skills.

Tutorials will provide a forum for students to develop design skills and to practice presentations.

Fortnightly milestone write-ups will assist in developing students ability to reflect on their own work.

## Lab Classes

Lab classes aim to give you practice in problem-solving and program development.

Following the tutorial class each week, there will be a two-hour laboratory class, during which you will work on a variety of small practical problems involving the concepts and strategies introduced in lectures. Because this course is has a significant practical component, laboratory classes are important. If you do not put a good amount of effort into the lab classes you risk failing the final exam.

Each week, there will be one or more exercises to work on. These exercises will be released in the week preceding the lab class. Labs will be done in pairs, and you and you partner should discuss the exercises before going to the lab, to maximise the usefulness of the class. Some of the exercises must be done in pairs, while others may be done individually: this will be explicitly noted with each exercise.

The exercises will need to be submitted, and will be assessed both as part of the fortnightly milestone write-ups (see below), as well as with a series of automated tests, which will assess correctness as well as programming style. During the lab, your tutor will provide feedback on your approach to the problem and on the style of your solution.

Tutors will facilitate you forming pairs in your week 1 lab. The pairs will change several times during session.

Starting in week 2, pairs will also be asked to do code reviews in the tutorials, to explain how they tackled a particular problem and describe interesting features of their solution.
